This guide explains how to edit events in Servv for WordPress, including both one-time and recurring events.

### Open the Events Section
Navigate to **Servv > Events** from the dashboard menu.

### Select an Event to Edit
Click the **hamburger icon** (three horizontal lines) next to the event you want to edit in the Events list.

Choose one of the following options:

- **Edit Event**: to modify the main event (suitable for one-time events or the core of a recurring series).
- **Edit Occurrences**: to modify a specific instance of a recurring event.
