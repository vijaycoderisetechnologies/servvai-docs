## Enable Email Notifications
**Turn It On**: Switch the toggle to **ON** to allow email notifications for your events. This is the main setting that enables all email-based reminders.  

**Note**: If this is disabled, no email reminders (first, second, finished, or additional) will be sent.

## Set Up the First Reminder
- **Enable First Reminder** toggle and switch it to **ON**.  
- **Specify the Time**: In the "Time to First Reminder" field, enter the number of hours before the event when you want the first reminder email sent.  

   **Example**: 24 hours, meaning the reminder will be sent one day before the event.  

## Set Up the Second Reminder
- **Enable Second Reminder** toggle and switch it to **ON**.  
- **Specify the Time**: In the "Time to Second Reminder" field, enter the number of hours before the event for the second reminder email.  

    **Example**: 2 hours, meaning the reminder will be sent two hours before the event starts.  

## Configure the Finished Reminder
- **Enable the Finished Reminder**  
- **Purpose**: This sends an email notification after the event concludes, useful for follow-ups or confirming the event is complete.  
**Note**: No time setting is required, as this email is triggered automatically after the event ends.


## Customize Additional Email Notification Settings
**Add Extra Reminder Emails**:  

- In the **Additional Reminder Emails List** field, enter a comma-separated list of email addresses (e.g., `john@example.com,jane@example.com`) to receive extra reminder emails.  
- These emails are sent in addition to the standard reminders.

**Set Additional Reminder Time**:  
In the "Additional Reminder Hours" field, specify the number of hours before the event for these extra reminders.  

**Example**: The default is 2 hours, meaning additional reminders are sent two hours before the event.
 
Adjust this based on your needs (e.g., 6 for six hours before).

**Skip Staff Email Notifications**: 
Find the **Skip Staff Email Notification** toggle and switch it to **ON** if you want to exclude staff members from receiving any of the configured email notifications.  

**Use Case**: Enable this if staff don’t need reminders (e.g., they’re already informed via other channels).

### Saving Changes
After configuring the desired settings, click the **Save** button at the top of the Settings panel.

**Outcome**: All configured settings will be saved and applied as default values when creating new events in Servv AI.  

## Tips for Success
- **Test Your Settings**: After configuring, schedule a test event to ensure emails are sent at the correct times and to the right recipients.  
- **Coordinate Timing**: Space out the first, second, and additional reminders to avoid overwhelming recipients (e.g., 24 hours, 2 hours, and 6 hours for additional reminders).  
- **Check Email Addresses**: Double-check the comma-separated list for typos to ensure additional reminders reach the intended recipients.  
- **Use Skip Staff Option Wisely**: Only enable "Skip Staff Email Notification" if staff are managed separately to avoid confusion.

By following these instructions, you’ll have a fully customized reminder system that keeps everyone informed before and after events.
