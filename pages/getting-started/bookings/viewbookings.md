The booking table lists all bookings with the following columns:

- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each booking.
- **Order Date/Time**: Date and time when the booking was created.
- **Registrant**: Email of registrant.
- **Event Title/Location**: Name of the event and its location (in-person or virtual).
- **Occurrence**: Indicates if the event is a one-time or recurring event.
- **Mode**: Payment details (e.g., shows amount if paid, or Free if the event is free).
- **Status**: Current status of the booking (e.g., Confirmed, Cancelled, Pending).

Each row represents a single booking, providing a clear overview of all events.

### Table Customization

You can customize the table using the **Customize** option on the top right.  
Click on **Customize** and simply **check** the fields you want to display in the table, or **uncheck** the ones you don’t.

### Filtering Bookings

The Booking Section includes a filter option to control the time range of displayed bookings. The available filter options are:

- **All**: Displays all bookings regardless of date.
- **12 Months**: Shows bookings from the past 12 months.
- **30 Days**: Shows bookings from the past 30 days.
- **7 Days**: Shows bookings from the past 7 days.

The selected filter is set as the default view. When revisiting the Booking Section, the table will display bookings based on the last selected filter.

### Searching Bookings
Users can search for specific bookings using the following methods:

- **Event Name Search**: Enter the event title in the search bar to find matching bookings.

- **Date Range Picker**: Select a custom date range to filter bookings within specific start and end dates.

The search functionality allows quick access to relevant bookings based on event details or timeframes.

### Advance Filtering
A **Filter** button, located beside the search bar and date picker, allows refining the booking list by setting a Price Range (minimum and maximum values).

After selecting the desired filters, click **Apply** to update the booking table with the filtered results.

### Resend Confirmation and Cancel Booking
Each booking in the table includes a hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) beside the Status column. Clicking this menu reveals two action options:

- **Resend Confirmation**: Sends a confirmation email to the customer for the selected booking.
- **Cancel Booking**: Cancels the selected booking, updating its status to Cancelled and notifying the customer.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/bookingaction.png" alt="Servv" width="300" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />

Displays a success message upon completion or an error message if the action fails.

These actions allow administrators to manage bookings efficiently without navigating away from the table.
